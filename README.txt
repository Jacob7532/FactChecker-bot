<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS<h1>

<h2>Fact Checker Discord Bot<h2>

This discord bot is used to check how factual another users statment is by using ChatGPT to check its validity.

This is just a little project for me to try and test out the ChatGPT API and to test out its capabilities in a somewhat productive way.

Usage:

Respond to any users message with "!factcheck" and the bot will access the statemetns and respond with whether the statment is factual or ficticious and will provide a link to a resource that supports the outcome.
