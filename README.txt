WORK IN PROGRESS

Fact Checker Discord Bot

This bot was created using Javascript along with the discord.js library. This bot, when called upon in response to a message will call upon ChatGPTâ€™s API which in turn will determine whether the message is factual or fictitious. Once that is determined the API will return a message and the bot responds with its verdict along with a resource that supports said verdict. Currently a work in progress, will hopefully be hosted on AWS once completed to allow for public usage across Discord.

This is just a project for me to try and test out the ChatGPT API and to test out its capabilities in a somewhat productive way.


Bot Usage:

Respond to any users message with "!factcheck" and the bot will access the statemetns and respond with whether the statment is factual or ficticious and will provide a link to a resource that supports the outcome.
